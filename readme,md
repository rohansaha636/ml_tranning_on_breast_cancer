# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple machine learning implementation to classify breast cancer tumors as **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)**.

The goal of this project was to practice:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Model comparison

---

## 📂 Dataset

* Dataset downloaded using **Kaggle API**
* Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
* Downloaded directly into local environment using Kaggle API
* Stored and processed locally

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Kaggle API
* Anaconda (Python environment management)
* Visual Studio Code (development environment)
* Git & GitHub (version control)

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Downloaded dataset using Kaggle API
2. Loaded dataset using Pandas
3. Cleaned and prepared the data
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling
6. Trained multiple models:

   * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   * Logistic Regression
   * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   * Random Forest
7. Tuned hyperparameters manually and using GridSearchCV
8. Compared model accuracies
9. Visualized performance using graphs

---

## 📊 Models Tested

* KNN (tuned number of neighbors)
* Logistic Regression (tuned C value)
* SVM (tuned C and kernel)
* Random Forest (tuned number of estimators)

---

## 🎯 Results

The models achieved high accuracy (around ~95–97%).
Hyperparameter tuning helped improve performance slightly.

Random Forest and SVM performed especially well on this dataset.
